            <h3>Game Description</h3>
            <p class="bodyText">
                A Waste of Space is a VR narrative game that touches on an enviromental problem many people don't think about yet, but will become a large problem in the future. Space pollution is a growing concern as the privatisation of space travel has left the job of keeping space clean to profit seekers. This VR experience puts the player in the role of a cleanup crew in the year 2060, after the effects of space pollution. The player is tasked with cleaning up space, which involves learning how to use the magnet gun to pull and deposit debris while controlling their thrusters. As the experience goes on, it becomes clear keeping space clean was not the priority for your employer.

            <h3>Concept Design</h3>
            <p class="bodyText">
                At the start of the project we brainstormed the types of topics we would be interested in creating a VR experience on. My personal interest was doing something that involved space movement because it isn't something people can experience easily and it is difficult to do in VR due to motion sickness.
            </p>

              <figcaption>Initial brainstorming of ideas</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p class="bodyText">
                Our team had some difficulty deciding on a topic as we had two large social issues the team was split on, pollution and discrimination. Since we could not come to an agreement we decided to look at the pros and cons of the two larger topics, as well as diving deeper into what each one could involve. We did this through affinity mapping, grouping similar concepts together on sticky notes. Through this process we were able to visually see that there would be a lot of challenges to doing a discrimination focused project. We also were able to narrow down our pollution idea to space pollution, and all our minds started racing about how we could tackle that topic from narrative to assets. We decided as a team to go with space pollution and began working on some detailed concepts.
            </p>

            <p class="bodyText">
              With our idea in hand we began working on both a prototype and a design doc. The design doc can be found <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/iat445team1-4/design-doc?authuser=0">here</a>. I worked on fleshing out some of the ideas in the document but my main work was on the prototype. We did an early prototype in order to test some of the features we knew would be a challenge.

            </figure>

            <p class="bodyText">
                With our concept finalized we began working on a <a class="inText" href="pdf/planetarycontrol/DesignDoc.pdf" target="_blank">design doc</a> and <a class="inText" href="pdf/planetarycontrol/Presentation.pdf" target="_blank">slide deck</a>. I refined the idea and wrote down details for the high concept, pitch, audience, gameplay structure, player mechanics, aesthetic artifacts, game world, story, design justification, development timeline, test plan, risks and alternatives.
            </p>

            <p class="bodyText">
                For the player mechanics I created a list of the unit types the player could choose from. These 12 archetypes were designed to give each one a unique playstyle and synergies with other units. The Scout, for example, has high visibility range and can move the most units per turn. The Sniper has high attack range but can't move very many units in a turn. The player could synergize by sending the scout to find enemies and attack with the sniper from a safe location. The Paladin has a large shield that can block shots and passively gives a shield to nearby allies. The Medic has low health and damage but provides a passive heal at the end of each turn to nearby allies. Placing the Paladin in front of the Medic keeps the Medic safe while keeping the Paladin's health topped up. Every unit was carefully considered with the roster.

            </figure>

            <p class="bodyText">
                I also knew that these mechanics would need to be consistent across the primary and secondary gameplay modes (strategy and third person). The Sniper's attack range is reflected in the damage falloff of their rifle in third person. The Paladin's shield can take a lot of damage if being attacked from the front. The Scout can escape fights by being very fast but they are at risk by being the closest to enemy lines. All the units I designed had this consideration put into them.

            <h3>Iteration</h3>
            <p class="bodyText">
                After successfully pitching the idea and receiving some good feedback I began working on refinement. I started with research into existing games in the genre. Two games of note were Fire Emblem and Valkyria Chronicles because they were doing similar hybrid mechanics. I analyzed the two games and used the findings to refine our concept.
            </p>

            <p class="bodyText">
                From <i>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</i> I found the game had noticable differences to our idea. The combat is showcased in third person but the player has no control over the unit. The upgrading mechanics of the units was interesting though as it added a layer of decision making that clearly affected the end game of battles. I incoprorated this into our concept by giving each unit upgradable stats that would be reflected in both isometric and third person modes and be consistent with the archetype pros and cons.
            </p>

            <figure>

                <figcaption>Fire Emblem: Three Houses combat shift to Third Person</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p class="bodyText">
                <i>Valkyria Chronicles 4</i> Was the closest game to ours from the ones I researched. It featured a similar core loop of allowing the player to go into third person and control the unit directly. However, where it differed was in the mechanics. Units can be moved around in third person but to attack they must go stationary and aim a reticle. The opponent is also not attacking back at this time. This reaffirmed mechanics from our game where the player has full control of the unit in battles and the enemy unit fights back. It meant that the emphasis of the turn based strategy was on positioning and planning whereas the emphasis of the third person mode was on hand eye coordination. The player would need to master both to be good at our game.

            <h3>Refinement</h3>
            <p class="bodyText">
                Once the idea had been iterated on it was time to update and document the mechanics. In a <a class="inText" href="pdf/planetarycontrol/leveldesign.pdf" target="_blank">second design doc</a> I documented the core loop, smart depth variations and functional flowboard with diagrams. Of note was the smart depth variations which included new mechanics like contextual map boosts and squad sizes. These would give players more choice over where to move their units and avoid creating a dominant strategy of rushing the other player. I also documented the lore backstory of each unit to give them more personality, which was inspired by the success of games like Overwatch.

            </figure>

            <p class="bodyText">
                I also began the <a class="inText" href="pdf/planetarycontrol/revisedleveldesign.pdf" target="_blank">level design doc</a> to give our artists some direction and document intial testing of the prototype. The main points in the design of the level are the map boosts, cover structure and pathways. The level is designed using a spider-web layout to fit our sandbox-style gameplay. At any point the player has several options of where to move to and each has its own pros and cons. The center of the map has a lot of cover but is also exposed to the tall buildings. The bridges can be used to access the side buildings on either side but they are the longest route to the enemy base and have little cover. This setup works to achieve our desired pacing where the early game has the least amount of options so players can plan ahead and the late game has players fighting in the middle of the map with a lot more third person action happening.

            <p class="bodyText">
                I also documented the reward structure in this <a class="inText" href="pdf/planetarycontrol/revisedleveldesign.pdf" target="_blank">design doc</a>. The level uses three reward schedules. The first is a static per-interval reward of Currency on every turn. Later this will allow players to buy things like upgrades with that currency. The second is static per-action where capturing certain control points will give a static amount of rewards. The reward types include weapon damage boost, unit
                health boost, strafe speed boost, run speed boost, jump height boost, and energy boost. Later on, the player will also be able to buy these with the currency they are earning per round. The final is variable per-action. Some control point rewards are randomized from the possible reward types so that they don't become the dominant strategy.

            <h3>Playtesting</h3>
            <p class="bodyText">
                I worked on the playtesting as well, running some sessions and creating the design questions/questionnaire in our design docs. Design areas I specifically wanted to look at were the transition between isometric to third person, strategic thinking, AI difficulty and unit movement. Of these we found some issues in the transition from iso to third person that we smoothed out and some unit movement QoL additions so that their behaviour is clearer. One thing that learned from the playtests was that players were trying to explore the map even though we didn't have any secrets. This gave me the idea to add some minor paths that advanced players could learn, which ended up being jump paths between buildings.

            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p class="bodyText">
                Since I was the primary programmer on the team, I also handled most of the programming. This is covered extensively on the <a class="inText" href="https://teamsaberishpreet.home.blog/blog-feed/page/1/">game's blog page</a> so I will just talk about about the challenges here.
            </p>

            <p class="bodyText">
                The ambition of this project meant that I was constantly exploring ways to achieve our design goals. For the multiplayer I landed on Unet despite it being in the process of deprication because it had the most documentation at the time. It served our purposes in the end. I also changed the combat to be more fluid rather than grid based and used Unity's NavMesh tool to achieve that. It was one of the most successful parts of the final build. Third person shooting was a new control scheme for me and there were some challenges getting the third person mode to communicate with the NavMesh colliders. We had to put some of the features in cold storage due to the time constraints but we managed to deliver a fun core loop in the end.
            </p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p class="bodyText">
                My main takeaway from this project was that making games is hard. Harder than I expected despite having a few games completed. It became a running joke amongst our team that we would say "that shouldn't be too hard" to any new feature idea early on but as we started the implementation the difficulty became clear. Despite the difficulty we were rewarded with a technical achievement award from our industry judges for being the only team daring enough to make an online multiplayer game and somewhat succeed.
            </p>
            <p class="bodyText">
                The project gave me a lot of tools to use as a game designer and a lot of methods for avoiding pitfalls as a programmer. Even though we may not have succeeded at our original idea, we all learned a lot from trying and the project gave me more confidence as a programmer and designer.
